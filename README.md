# Pymaceuticals, Inc. - Clinical Study Analysis

## Overview

Welcome to the data analysis repository for **Pymaceuticals, Inc.**, a fictional pharmaceutical company focused on developing anti-cancer medications. This project is based on a **hypothetical dataset** designed to simulate a clinical study aimed at identifying effective treatments for **squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)**, a common form of skin cancer.

In this simulated study, **249 mice** diagnosed with SCC were treated with various drug regimens, including Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, **Capomulin**. Over a span of **45 days**, tumor growth in each mouse was observed and measured to assess the efficacy of each treatment.

The purpose of this repository is to:
- Provide all the necessary data visualizations, tables, and figures to support a **fictional** technical report for this clinical study.
- Offer a top-level summary of the **hypothetical** study results comparing the effectiveness of **Capomulin** to other treatment regimens.

## Project Structure

- **Data**: The raw data simulates observations of tumor development, drug regimens administered, and other relevant variables over time.
- **Analysis**: The analysis compares the efficacy of Capomulin against other treatments, measuring tumor volume reduction.
- **Visualizations**: Various charts and figures are generated to visualize tumor progression, treatment efficacy, potential outliers, and correlations between variables like tumor size and mouse weight.
- **Summary**: A high-level overview of the fictional studyâ€™s findings, focusing on the comparative performance of Capomulin.

## Objectives

- **Generate Tables and Figures**: Create detailed data tables and visualizations that show tumor progression and drug efficacy for each treatment.
- **Compare Drug Efficacy**: Highlight how Capomulin performs relative to other treatments and provide statistical insights.
- **Summarize Key Findings**: Provide a concise summary of the **fictional** study results for the executive team.

## Key Findings (TBD)

The results and conclusions of this hypothetical study will focus on the performance of Capomulin compared to the other treatments. Stay tuned for updates as the analysis progresses!
